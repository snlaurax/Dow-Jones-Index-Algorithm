# Dow-Jones-Index-Algorithm

## Project Summary
The performance of stocks has been an increasingly popular topic of research. Whether a stakeholder should buy or sell a stock is highly dependent on many factors such as the current economic conditions and past stock performance. Machine Learning has recently been explored as a tool that stakeholders can use to help make predictions on top of the existing indexes. I chose to apply linear regression, k-means clustering and random forest regression to 2011 stocks in the Dow Jones Index to evaluate how strongly they fit the data. The data set was taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/dow+jones+index.
